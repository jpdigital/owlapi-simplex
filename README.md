# owlapi-simplex

The (OWL API)[http://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/] the de facto standard way for
working with OWL ontologies. If used in software projects using the OWL API
often requires a lot a boiler plate code. This project provides

* A code generator 
* Some utility classes

which make using the OWL API simpler to use. In essence, the code generator
automatically generates the boiler plate code from an OWL ontology.

For information how to use **owlapi-simplex** can be found at [https://jpdigital.github.io/owlapi-simples](http://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/).

This project is an early development state. If you find a bug and miss a 
feature please open an issue.
